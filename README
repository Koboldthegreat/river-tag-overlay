river-tag-overlay - A pop-up showing tag status

A tool for the river Wayland compositor that will show a pop-up with symbolic
information about the currently focused and occupied tags whenever the tag focus
changes.

*This is a fork*: it includes changes that make it pop-up whenever you switch between outputs,
this can be useful to keep track of the focused output (active monitor) in a multi-monitor setup

see https://sr.ht/~leon_plickat/river-tag-overlay/ for the original project
